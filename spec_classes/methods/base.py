class MethodDescriptor(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    A [descriptor](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html) object that
    is used by spec-classes to attach methods to classes. It is implemented as
    a descriptor so that methods are only generated when they are needed, and
    so that we can easily split out the implementation of a method from its
    generated (user-friendly) wrapper.

    By default, this descriptor is "dissolved" and replaced by the generated
    method once it is accessed by the users. You can disable this by passing
    `dissolve=False` to the constructor.

    Subclasses should implement `method_name` and `build_method`.

    Class Attributes:
        method_name: The intended (default) name for this method. The actual
            name may differ (see `attr_name`).

    Attributes:
        attr_name: The name assigned to this method during attaching to a class.
            If it is not yet attached, this will be `None`. This may differ from
            `method_name` if the method was attached via an alias.
        spec_cls: The spec class to which this method is attached. It is
            populated optionally in the constructor, and when Python attaches
            this object to the host class.
        dissolve: Whether to dissolve this descriptor by replacing itself with
            the generated method after it is accessed for the first time
            (resulting in this object being garbage collected). By default this
            is true.
